# JS streaming feeder protocol

A wire protocol that lets an agent runtime ("feeder") drive Open Computer Use's
`js` speculative streaming engine as the model's tool call streams, so
model-generation latency overlaps execution. This is the integration contract for
agent builders. It is deliberately small and language-agnostic.

## Why a separate protocol (not MCP)

Standard MCP delivers a whole `tools/call` as one request; an MCP server never
sees partial tool-call arguments. Streaming per-line execution therefore cannot
live behind MCP. It has to be driven by the component that owns the model's token
stream — the agent runtime. This protocol is how that runtime talks to the
engine. (The engine is the same one behind the MCP `js` tool; a feeder is just an
alternative front end that can stream into it.)

## Transport

- The feeder spawns `open-computer-use stream`. One process is one persistent
  runtime session (one JavaScript scope, shared across cells).
- Framing is newline-delimited JSON (JSONL), UTF-8, exactly one JSON object per
  line, in both directions. Requests on the process's stdin, responses on stdout.
  The server writes unbuffered; the feeder should too.
- It is synchronous request/response: one response line per request line, in
  order. There are no unsolicited frames in this version.

## Requests

Every request is a JSON object with an `op`. A cell is one streamed tool call.

| op | fields | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `begin` | `cell` | Start a cell. Resets the output sink for that cell. |
| `feed` | `cell`, `source` | `source` is the **full code generated so far** (a growing prefix). The engine runs every statement that has newly completed since the last feed. |
| `finish` | `cell`, `source?` | The full source has arrived. Runs the trailing statement and returns the cell's result. `source` is optional; if given it must still be a prefix-extension. |
| `abandon` | `cell` | The host will never finish this call (skipped/aborted/stream cut). Returns the result; statements already run stay run. |
| `reset` | — | Clear the persistent `globalThis` scope and re-initialize the runtime. |

## Responses

| for | shape |
|---|---|
| `begin` | `{"op":"begin","cell":<id>,"ok":true}` |
| `feed` | `{"op":"feed","cell":<id>,"completed":<int>,"failed":<bool>,"error":<string|null>}` |
| `finish` | `{"op":"finish","cell":<id>,"result":{"content":[…],"isError":<bool>}}` |
| `abandon` | `{"op":"abandon","cell":<id>,"result":{…}}` |
| `reset` | `{"op":"reset","ok":true}` |
| bad request | `{"op":<op?>,"error":<string>}` |

`result` has the same shape as an MCP tool result (`content` is an array of
`{"type":"text","text":…}` and `{"type":"image","data":<base64>,"mimeType":"image/png"}`).
Hand it back to the model as the `js` tool's output.

## Compliance rules

1. **`source` is the full accumulated code, never a delta.** Extract the `code`
   field from the streaming tool-call arguments as they accumulate, and send what
   you have so far. The engine diffs against what it already ran.
2. **The prefix may only grow.** A `feed`/`finish` whose `source` is not a prefix
   of what already ran fails the cell (`"source diverged; earlier statements may
   have run"`). Never send a rewritten prefix.
3. **One cell at a time.** `begin` → `feed`* → (`finish` | `abandon`) before the
   next `begin`. Cells share one scope, so use `globalThis` for values that must
   survive a cell, and avoid re-declaring the same `let` in a later cell.
4. **On the model completing the call,** send `finish` with the final source and
   return its `result` to the model.
5. **On skip/abort/stream-cut,** send `abandon`; its `result` says how many
   statements had already run.

## Semantics

- **Fail-stop.** A statement that throws fails the cell; later statements and
  later feeds do not run. `completed` stops advancing and `failed` becomes true.
- **Shared REPL scope.** Statements run in one persistent scope via the engine's
  interpreter, so a `let` in one statement is visible to the next.
- **Idle/timeout.** Each statement is bounded (30 s); a runaway statement is
  terminated and fails the cell.

## Safety — read this before feeding mutations

The engine runs in **full speculation**: every statement, including mutating
actions (`cua.click`, `cua.type`, `cua.drag`, `cua.setValue`), runs during `feed`,
as it streams. The divergence guard and `abandon` **surface** a diverged or
abandoned stream; they cannot **undo** a click or keystroke already sent to the
real desktop.

A feeder that needs safety controls this itself, because it decides what to feed:
feed read-only prefixes eagerly (the slow accessibility reads — `cua.getState`,
`cua.elements`, `cua.find`, `cua.screenshot`), and **hold the prefix at the last
line before a mutating call until `finish`.** That captures the read latency while
never performing an irreversible action on an uncommitted stream. creator-agent
retired its own speculative path (decision D30) precisely because an abandoned
speculative mutation corrupts a persistent session.

## Example

```
→ {"op":"begin","cell":"t1"}
← {"op":"begin","cell":"t1","ok":true}
→ {"op":"feed","cell":"t1","source":"const b = cua.find(\"Notes\", e => e.role===\"AXButton\");\n"}
← {"op":"feed","cell":"t1","completed":1,"failed":false,"error":null}
→ {"op":"feed","cell":"t1","source":"const b = cua.find(\"Notes\", e => e.role===\"AXButton\");\nif (b) cua.click(\"Notes\", { element_index: b.index });\n"}
← {"op":"feed","cell":"t1","completed":2,"failed":false,"error":null}
→ {"op":"finish","cell":"t1"}
← {"op":"finish","cell":"t1","result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":""}],"isError":false}}
```

## Versioning

This is version 1. Fields may be added; a compliant feeder ignores unknown
response fields. Multi-cell pipelining (a cell returning before its source is
complete so the model predicts the next call) is a possible future extension and
is not part of v1.
